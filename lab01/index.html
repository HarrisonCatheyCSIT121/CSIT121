<h1>Baby Lima Beans</h1>
<h2>Recipe by Ronald Cathey (father of author)</h2>
<p>This recipe was created by my Dad. The original recipe came from the back of a packet of lima beans, but has been modified with few different ingredients and a different process. This is a hearty dish that is great for cold days, and should be served over rice. This is my favorite dish because it is easy to make, cheap, healthy, and delicious.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 Yellow Onions</li>
  <li>2 Greeen Peppers</li>
  <li>2 Stalks of Celery</li>
